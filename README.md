# Advances in Financial Machine Learning Solutions
This repo contains solutions for selected exercises from [Advances in Financial Machine Learning] by Marcos Lopez De Prado. You can find solutions for selected chapter in the corresponding `ipynb`-file, and all the necessary functions that appear throughout the book are implemented in the `Functions.ipynb` file.

Please note that solutions may be incomplete. I also sometimes use different data from what is expected in the book and some numbers may change due to the differences in data.
