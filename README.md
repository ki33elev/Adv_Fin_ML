# Advances in Financial machine Learning Solutions
This repo contains solutions for selected exercises from Advances in Financial machine Learning by Marcos Lopez De Prado. You can find solutions for selected chapter in the corresponding ipynb-file.

Please note that solutions may be uncomplete. I also sometimes use different data from what is expected in the book and that some numbers may change due to the differences in data.
